## Project Info

### Description

**MobEffectsVFX** is a client-side mod that adds new visuals when a player gains an effect.

In Fantasy-RPG fashion, the player will be surrounded by a fast moving aura when an effect is applied to them. Depending on the nature and color of the applied effect, the aura will change its behaviour (ex. A beneficial effect will have an upward moving animation, while a harmful one will move downwards).

The mod currently supports 3 VFX options: **Rising**, **Stationary** and **Flat**.
Other independant configurability options include: **VFX Opacity** and **Duration**.

*Note: the mod it's still in early stage, so there might be bugs and issues related to it.*
